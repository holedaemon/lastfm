# lastfm

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/holedaemon/lastfm.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/holedaemon/lastfm)

A very rudimentary Go library for last.fm's archaic API. Only covers what I need for other projects. Most likely never will be stable; expect breaking changes. There is no God within these halls.
